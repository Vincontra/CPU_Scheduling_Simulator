# CPU Scheduling Simulator

## 📌 Overview
This project is a Java-based simulator for **CPU Scheduling Algorithms** used in Operating Systems. It helps visualize how different scheduling policies decide the execution order of processes. The simulator supports popular algorithms such as:

- First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)
- Shortest Job Next (SJN)
- Round Robin (RR)

The goal of the simulator is to help users compare scheduling behavior and performance metrics like waiting time, turnaround time, and CPU utilization through an interactive interface.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Different scheduling algorithms perform better in different scenarios. Some minimize waiting time, others improve response time or throughput. Choosing the “best” algorithm depends on system goals — and this simulator allows you to **experiment and analyze** these trade-offs.

Users select a scheduling algorithm, enter process details (burst time, arrival time, priority, etc.), and the simulator visually demonstrates how processes are executed inside the CPU.

## 🚀 Features
- **Multiple Scheduling Algorithms**
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**
- **Execution Timeline & Ready Queue View**
- **Performance Metrics Display**
- **Custom Data Structures for Scheduling**

## 📁 Files and Directories
- `src/main/` — Main Java source code
- `sources/` — Additional source files
- `target/` — Compiled output
- `pom.xml` — Maven configuration

---

## 🛠 Getting Started

### ✅ Prerequisites
- Java JDK 8 or higher
- (Optional) Apache Maven
- Any Java IDE (IntelliJ, Eclipse, etc.)

---

## 📥 Installation
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/Vincontra/CPU_Scheduling_Simulator.git


Open the project in your IDE.

---

## ▶️ Usage
1. Compile the project (your IDE will normally do this)
2. Run the **main class inside `src/main/`**
3. Select a scheduling algorithm
4. Enter process details
5. View execution order & performance results

---

## 📌 Example — Round Robin
1. Open the simulator
2. Select **Round Robin**
3. Enter number of processes
4. Click **Start**
5. View the execution sequence and metrics
